TOOLS WILL ONLY WORK IN VSCODE. <br/>
unfortunatley tools will not work in csel terminal on csel because of how it is configured. however they will work on your csel vscode terminal. yes this makes no sense but trust the process.<br/>
to setup run ```source ./setup.sh```<br/>
to apply tools run ```source ~/.bashrc```
## functionality
in terminal run ```cshelp```
